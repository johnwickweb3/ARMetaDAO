## What is ARMetaDAO?
It is a metadata management platform built on arweave. You can convert any media resource or content into ARMeta and store it on arweave, and you can govern your ARMeta with a DAO, which makes your metadata more flexible.

### ARMeta
Each ARMeta is a [smartweave](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/SmartWeave) smart contract, It has its own Id, you can query each ARMeta by Id, you can use it as the Token URI of NFT, and it can be used for each chain.


### ARMeta DAO
Each ARMeta will generate an ARMeta-DAO. ARMeta-DAO is composed of ARMeta's governors. They decide the development of ARMeta through voting. Voting can modify media resources, names, descriptions, attributes, and governance members. This makes the metadata upgradable, and the DAO guarantees fairness on each upgrade.   
DAO has been supported to modify ARMeta options:

* Add DAO Members
* Remove DAO Members
* Change Image
* Change Name
* Change Description
* Add Attributes
* Remove Attributes
* Change Governance Rules   



   
## Why use ARMetaDAO?
### Make NFTs more interesting
Metadata is widely used in NFTs. We have an NFT, but we don't really have the metadata bound to the NFT. ARMeta can allow metadata to be modified, if you have a Punk NFT, but its name is punk #89, if your metadata can be modified, you can name it Alice's punk, you can even add more you want to display information. Make your NFT data more interesting.

### Increase collaboration
Several painters or writers can work together to create an ARmeta. Each modification is voted on by participants, and modification records can be stored in arwearve, which forms a self-organizing network.

### ARMetaDAO does not destroy metadata
You may think that this will destroy the NFT metadata. In fact, the right to modify the data is an option. It is determined by the governance rules of the DAO. When you define ARMeta, you can decide whether each data is modified or not. For example you can set your punk ARMeta, the image option cannot be modified.
